## Overview

Harp is a HPC-ABDS (High Performance Computing Enhanced Apache Big Data Stack) framework designed to provide distributed machine learning and data-intensive applications. The framework aims to run data analytics algorithms on distributed HPC architectures.

## Key Features

**Data Abstraction**
Enhanced data processing capabilities beyond traditional Hadoop and MapReduce paradigms, supporting complex data interactions and communication patterns.

**Communication Framework**
Advanced collective communication support for efficient parallel processing, similar to how strings in a harp create concordant sound.

**Integration Capabilities**
Seamless integration with Hadoop 1.2.1 and Hadoop 2.2.0, supporting various data abstraction types including arrays, key-values, and graphs.

## Technical Implementation

### Data Processing Capabilities
- Support for complicated data abstractions
- Enhanced communication patterns
- Map-collective programming models
- Advanced transformation operations

### Performance Features
- Better sustainability than Twister or Twisted-Azure
- Improved fault tolerance properties
- Efficient collective communication for data processing
- Support for K-means clustering and multi-dimensional scaling

## Applications

The Harp framework supports various applications including:
- K-means clustering
- Multi-dimensional scaling
- PageRank algorithms
- Complex data analytics operations

## Advantages

- **Enhanced Performance**: Superior data processing capabilities compared to traditional tools
- **Flexible Architecture**: Support for various data types and communication patterns
