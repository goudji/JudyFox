## Introduction

Large-scale high dimensional data visualization is highly valuable for scientific discovery in many fields of data mining and information retrieval. PlotViz is a 3D data point browser that visualizes large volume of 2- or 3-dimensional data as points in a virtual space on a computer screen and enable users to explore the virtual space interactively. PlotViz was initially designed to consume outputs of dimension reduction algorithms for visualizing high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space, such as Multi-dimensional Scaling (MDS) and Generative Topographic Mapping (GTM). Used together with such dimension reduction algorithms, PlotViz can help users to discover intrinsic structures of high-dimensional data and browse large volumes of data points interactively and efficiently in a virtual 3D space.
