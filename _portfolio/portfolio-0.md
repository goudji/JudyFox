## Research Overview

Our research focuses on three key technological innovations in racing analytics:

**Rank Forecasting**
Advanced predictive modeling system for race positions and performance metrics using real-time data analysis from IndyCar races.

**Video Image Detection**
Implementation of TensorFlow mobile networks for real-time racing car detection and tracking, enabling advanced visual analytics during races.

**Anomaly Detection**
Specialized wireframe modeling and detection algorithms for identifying unusual patterns and potential issues in racing data streams.

## Objectives

### Prediction
- **Increased driver safety**: Prediction of anomalies allows pre-emptive action to ensure safety of drivers
- **Accident prevention and preparedness**: Anomalies detected before time can allow for better preparedness by the ground crew and possible prevention in the case of team engineers
- **Real-time strategy using data**: We make data accessible in a usable form for racing teams to tackle problems real-time and in pace with the development of the race

### Analysis
- **Post-fact analysis for teams**: A set of anomalies could prove instrumental for racing teams to build upon previous races and practice runs to incrementally improve performance
- **Increasing engagement among fans**: New forms of sports analysis would lead to greater engagement among the audience. Selective data could be presented to fans on their phones during races
- **An evergrowing database**: A database of metrics on automobile performance could be usable not only in competitive contexts but also modified to apply to urban environments

## Equipment Malfunction Prediction and Alerts

Anomaly prediction can help engineers identify issues in the hardware before they become serious. Especially at the speed at which these cars travel, small issue can quickly snowball to become catastrophic.

## Recommendations with Evolving Driving Conditions

Track conditions are ever evolving, from humidity, ambient temperature and track temperature. All of these factors affect the way on-board systems perform in different ways. It can be hard for a human to take appropriate action at the appropriate time with such gradual change.

## Performance Tuning During Practice

Performance of hardware can be tuned to minute degrees based on insights provided by AI systems which can go beyond the level of pattern recognition capable by humans.
