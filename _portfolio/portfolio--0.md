## Introduction

Considering the difficulty of financial time series
forecasting in financial aid, much of the current research focuses
on leveraging big data analytics in financial services. One
modern approach is to utilize ”predictive analysis”, analogous
to forecasting financial trends. However, many of these time
series data in Financial Aid (FA) pose unique challenges due
to limited historical datasets and high dimensional financial
information, which hinder the development of effective predictive
models that balance accuracy with efficient runtime and memory
usage. Pre-trained foundation models are employed to address
these challenging tasks. We use state-of-the-art time series models
including pre-trained LLMs (GPT-2 as backbone), transformers,
and linear models to demonstrate their ability to outperform
traditional approaches, even with minimal (”few-shot”) or no
fine-tuning (”zero-shot”). Our benchmark study, which includes
financial aid with seven other time series tasks, shows the
potential of using LLMs for scarce financial datasets.
